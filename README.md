# Jupyter Show Image

Display images in jupyter web UI.

Encodes the image directly into HTML (base64) without going through matplotlib. 

The compression format is customizable. A single function call can show multiple images in a grid.

* `show(img_1, img_2)` will draw each image on a separate row
* `show([img_1, img_2])` will draw both images in one row
* `show([img_1, img_2], [img_3, img_4])` will draw two rows of two images

Specifying the format:  
* `show(..., fmt='webp')`: image format, usually png jpeg webp

Whether to try converting unusual shapes and datatypes to the needed RGB:  
* `show(..., adapt=True or False)`

Convenience functions `imread`, `imwrite` are also provided (based on PIL). 

### Demo
